/**
 * Indian PIN code → state, from the postal system's own regional structure.
 *
 * India's PIN allocation is geographic by design: the first two digits identify
 * a postal circle, which maps onto a state (or a small group of them). That
 * makes a ~40-row prefix table enough to validate "does this PIN belong to the
 * state the customer selected?" — no 19,000-row dataset, no network call, and it
 * works identically on the server and in the browser.
 *
 * MIRRORS Backend/src/lib/pincode.ts — keep the two tables in step. The server is
 * the enforcement point; this copy exists so the customer sees the problem while
 * still on the form rather than after pressing Place order.
 *
 * WHY THIS MATTERS BEYOND TIDINESS: the customer's state decides the GST split
 * on the invoice — CGST+SGST for an intra-state sale, IGST for inter-state (see
 * modules/orders/tax.ts). A customer who picks the wrong state produces a
 * legally incorrect invoice, so this is a tax-correctness check.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a city lookup. Two digits cannot resolve a district, and
 * guessing one wrong would be worse than letting the customer type it.
 */

/**
 * Two-digit PIN prefix → state name, matching the labels in the checkout state
 * dropdown exactly (comparison is normalised, but keeping them identical avoids
 * silent drift).
 *
 * Several circles legitimately cover more than one state — 73 spans Karnataka
 * and Goa, 79 spans several north-eastern states — so a prefix maps to a LIST
 * and a PIN is accepted if the selected state is any of them. Being permissive
 * where the postal system itself is ambiguous is correct; the alternative is
 * rejecting valid addresses.
